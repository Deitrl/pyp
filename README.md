pyp - The Pyed Piper
====================

This is the __unofficial__ git mirror for the pyp project. The original project page can be found at http://code.google.com/p/pyp/.

Installation
------------

 - On Mac OS X with homebrew, you can just `brew install pyp`
 - Otherwise, the easiest way would be to pull the raw pyp script (https://raw.github.com/yuvadm/pyp/master/pyp) and link it to your favorite `bin` location.
